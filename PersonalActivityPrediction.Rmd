## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which test subjects did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I may use any of the other variables to predict with.  I am to create a report describing how I built my model, how I used cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices you did. Finally, I will also use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
